									<h3 class="major">Things You Can Do To Prevent Child Abuse</h3>
									<p><strong><em>Volunteer your time.</em></strong> Get involved with other parents in your community. Help vulnerable children and their families.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Discipline your child thoughtfully.</em></strong> It is important to never discipline your child when you are upset.  Give yourself time to calm down. Giving your child discipline when you are upset only teaches them that it is okay. Remember that discipline is a way to teach your child. Use privileges to encourage good behavior and time outs to help your child control there behaviour.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Reflect on your behavior. Abuse is not just physical.</em></strong> Both words and actions can relate to abuse.  Use your actions to show children and other adults that conflicts can be settled without physical or verbally abusing them.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Involve yourself in outside groups with your child to strengthen your relationship.</em></strong> After-school activities, parent education classes, mentoring programs, and respite care are some of the many ways to keep children safe from harm.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Teach your child their rights.</em></strong> When children are taught there personal rights they feel more confident and know the diference between right and wrong. They are less likely to think abuse is their fault, and more likely to report an offender.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Support prevention programs and make sure you child knows.</em></strong> Things such as family counseling/ personal counseling and home visits from nurses who provide assistance for newborns are a great way to include yourself.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Know what child abuse is.</em></strong> By knowing the different types of abuse you know if you are abusing your child or if they are in danger of being abused by other adults or people older then them.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Know the signs.</em></strong> Unexplained injuries aren't the only signs of abuse. Depression, fear of a certain adult, difficulty trusting others or making friends, sudden changes in eating or sleeping patterns, inappropriate sexual behavior, poor hygiene, secrecy, and hostility are often signs of family problems and may indicate a child is being neglected, physically, sexually, or emotionally abused.</p>
                                    <p><strong><em>Report abuse.</em></strong> If you witness a child being harmed or see evidence of abuse, make a report to your  local police. When talking to a child about abuse, listen carefully, assure the child that theydid the right thing by telling an adult, and makesure they know that whatever happened, it wasnt their fault.</p>
